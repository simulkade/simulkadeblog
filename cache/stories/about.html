<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Ali Akbar Eftekhari. My family and friends call me Ehsan. I currently live in Lyngby, Denmark with my wife, Maryam, our daughter, Aida, and our son Aidin. I am a researcher (research assistant professor) in the <a href="http://www.oilgas.dtu.dk/english">Danish Hydrocarbon Research and Technology Centre</a> at the <a href="http://www.dtu.dk">Technical University of Denmark</a>.<br>
I have <a href="https://twitter.com/aidadaddy">a twitter account</a> that is barely used, a <a href="http://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=hBKHOIcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google scholar profile</a> where you can see a list of my publications, and a <a href="https://github.com/simulkade">github account</a> where you can find some of my codes. You can find my CV <a href="http://www.simulkade.com/stories/cv.html">here</a>, follow me on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ali_A_Eftekhari">Research Gate</a>, or add me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-a-eftekhari-5832a6133/">Linkedin</a>.<br>
As a human-being, I like to cook, mostly Iranian cuisine (tahchin, kabab koobideh, eggplant stew) and pizza. I also bake bread from time to time. I play some folklore Persian music with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setar">Setar</a>, and play video games on Wii with my daughter. I never go to gym, but I very much enjoy hiking and biking, while listening to the audio books of the novels I have already read. Speaking of novels, I have fun with fiction, specially post-apocalyptic novels or stories of the ordinary people.</p>
