<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a> version 4.0 is out, and the good news is that it has a <code>classdef</code> feature similar to Matlab. I will soon use it to update my <a href="https://github.com/simulkade/FVTool">FVTool</a> so that it can be used with all functionalities in Octave as well.<br />
The problem is that it takes a while before the new version of Octave comes to the software center of Ubuntu. I decided to compile and build it, although I've never had a good experience with building tools from source. This time however it worked however without any issue on my laptop and my pc. I used the procedure I found <a href="https://scivision.co/compiling-octave-4-0-on-ubuntu-14-04/">here</a>. I had to install some more libraries on my Mint 17.1 operating system.<br />
First, install these dependencies:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">sudo apt-get install gawk gfortran gperf flex libbison-dev libqhull-dev libglpk-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libfltk1.3-dev librsvg2-dev libqrupdate-dev libgl2ps-dev libosmesa6-dev libarpack2-dev libqscintilla2-dev libreadline-dev bison icontool llvm-dev libfftw3-dev libhdf5-serial-dev openjdk-7-jdk transfig  libgraphicsmagick++1-dev libsndfile1-dev
</pre>


<p>Then, download the <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave/">octave source code</a> for version 4.0.0 from <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave/octave-4.0.0.tar.gz">here</a>, and extract it. Go to the new octave-4.0.0 forlder, and in a terminal window type</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">./configure --enable-jit
make
sudo make install
</pre>


<p>It takes a while, so go and pour a nice cup of coffee for yourself. If you get any error after running <code>./configure</code>, find the missing dependencies <a href="http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_Debian_systems">here</a>.<br />
If the installation is successful, run octave by typing <code>octave</code>. It should launch the user interface of octave which is enabled by default in this version.<br />
One other good news is that now you can run octave in a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a>, by installing <a href="https://github.com/calysto/octave_kernel">octave kernel</a> and <a href="http://blink1073.github.io/oct2py/source/installation.html">oct2py</a>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">sudo pip install oct2py
sudo pip install octave_kernel
</pre>


<p>It is still not possible to use octave kernel. Go to <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and type</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">ls -la
</pre>


<p>You will see that <code>octave</code> is linked to the <code>octave-4.0.0</code>. You need to unlink <code>octave</code> and create a symbolic link to the octave command line interface or <code>octave-cli</code>. In the terminal window, type</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">sudo unlink octave
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/octave-cli octave
</pre>


<p>Now your octave kernel should start without any problem. Open a Jupyter notebook, and change the kernel to octave.</p>
