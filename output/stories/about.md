# About me
My name is Ali Akbar Eftekhari. My family and friends call me Ehsan. I currently live in Lyngby, Denmark with my wife, Maryam, our daughter, Aida, and our son Aidin. I am a researcher (research assistant professor) in the [Danish Hydrocarbon Research and Technology Centre](http://www.oilgas.dtu.dk/english) at the [Technical University of Denmark](http://www.dtu.dk).  
I have [a twitter account](https://twitter.com/aidadaddy) that is barely used, a [Google scholar profile](http://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=hBKHOIcAAAAJ&hl=en) where you can see a list of my publications, and a [github account](https://github.com/simulkade) where you can find some of my codes. You can find my CV [here](http://www.simulkade.com/stories/cv.html), follow me on [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ali_A_Eftekhari), or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-a-eftekhari-5832a6133/).  
As a human-being, I like to cook, mostly Iranian cuisine (tahchin, kabab koobideh, eggplant stew) and pizza. I also bake bread from time to time. I play some folklore Persian music with [Setar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setar), and play video games on Wii with my daughter. I never go to gym, but I very much enjoy hiking and biking, while listening to the audio books of the novels I have already read. Speaking of novels, I have fun with fiction, specially post-apocalyptic novels or stories of the ordinary people.
